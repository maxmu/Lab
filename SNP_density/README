Count.py is used for count how many genes are in total and how many genes have the LCR and how many genes do not own LCR.
#3 functions:
all_genes() : is to count the total number and return all the names of the genes as an array
LCR_genes() : is to count the number of genes that do possess LCR
not_own_LCR_genes(): is to count the number of genes that do not possess LCR
#information:
for human genome, I take 19965 genes into consideration and genes that possess LCR has a number of 4485 which makes 15480 genes do not possess LCR

extract_SNP.py is used to extract all the SNPs in introns in different genes(use the genes in block_total to get the range of each intron) becareful that the intron range do contain the boundary.
